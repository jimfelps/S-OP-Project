Next it's time to clean data. First go 'round on this process was a bit messy. I'd like to clean the source data before getting into the formatting. After that, I'll create lookup tables from the additional data (ship_date, customer_data, pa_expentitures) to add onto the MA table data. Once that's complete, I can build a summary by order that will include customer, project and order information by fiscal year. I'll use that table to create a classic/FT lookup so that any project that is a classic type project will be assigned as a C2/FT since we'll need this type of info when we get into engineering capacity work but won't be able to tell based on the number of engineering hours (they'll be mixed in with the simple complexity work). From there I'll create a project summary table in two views: with a "primary key" and without. When we get down to this summary level, I don't think we'll actually need the key, but all it is is the first 8 digits of the order number that 
should tie projects together, but we know that isn't the case based on the variance in observations between the two tables. I think the table with key is probably worthless, but we'll keep it just in case.
